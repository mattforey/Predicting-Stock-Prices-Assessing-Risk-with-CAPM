# Predicting-Stock-Prices-Assessing-Risk-with-CAPM
The goal of this study is to use predictive modeling to predict stock prices for the upcoming week using the previous weekâ€™s data. We also want to evaluate risk levels of these same stocks. The models that will be used for testing are a simple linear model, a decision tree model, and a support vector machine model. Lastly, the level of risk for each company will be determined using a capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to describe the relationship the observed returns have with unplanned systemic risk.
